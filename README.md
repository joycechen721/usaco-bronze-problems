# General Description 
collection of usaco bronze problems I did! some may not be complete, or may be missing a few test cases (because I simply cannot work my head around them). otherwise, the majority is fine and (hopefully) correct.

# Personal Thoughts
while I ultimately didn't decide to do usaco bronze this year (mostly because I know for a fact I can't make the time limit with 3 problems under 3 hours), I'm still happy that I managed to work my way through these problems. they were challenging and I faced unimaginable heights of self-doubt and hatred for my dumbness. even though a problem would sometimes take me days or weeks to think through, I did grow a lot from doing these problems, so I'm still glad I took time out of my precious summer and school days to overwork my brain cells. this project has led me to realize how untalented I am at algorithmic thinking, and that I'm probably going to have a hard time in college/future careers (as I'm pretty much set on pursuing CS). but hopefully, just hopefully, grit and passion can surpass talents and smarts. 

# How I Worked
literally just spontaneous bursts of energy - I worked on these problems sometimes once a week, greater periods during the summer, basically none during the first semester...and felt discouraged every time I logged onto usaco to finish them (because I couldn't think fast enough to get through an adhoc problem in minutes, as some ppl can - truly intensified my insecurities about whether I'm fit for this field or not). 

# Last Notes
to those of you struggling with usaco, know that there is someone dumber than you. I hope that encourages you to keep going!
